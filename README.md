**OVERVIEW:**
The Portfolio Website is a personal platform designed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. Built using HTML and CSS, the website features a clean and responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. I used CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout to structure the layout and ensure the website remains flexible and user-friendly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The website is divided into sections like "About Me," "Projects," "Resume," and "Contact," where visitors can easily navigate through my work and professional background. For styling, I focused on modern design principles, ensuring the website is visually appealing and easy to read, with proper use of typography, color schemes, and spacing.

By focusing on HTML and CSS, I gained experience in building static, responsive web pages, applying best practices for accessibility and visual hierarchy. This project helped me improve my skills in creating user-friendly, well-organized web interfaces without relying on JavaScript for interactivity
